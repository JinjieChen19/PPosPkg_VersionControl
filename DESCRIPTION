Description: This package is used to calculate the posterior predictive probability of success (PPoS) for a Bayesian model. The PPoS is the probability that the true response is greater than a threshold value. The PPoS is calculated by integrating the posterior predictive distribution of the response over the region of interest. The package provides functions to calculate the PPoS for a variety of models, including linear regression, logistic regression, and survival models. The package also provides functions to calculate the PPoS for a variety of threshold values. The package is designed to be easy to use and flexible, allowing users to specify their own models and threshold values.
