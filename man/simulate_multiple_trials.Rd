\arguments{
\item{n_sim}{Number of simulations to perform (default: 1000).}

\item{alpha_prior}{Shape parameter 1 of the Beta prior for the response rate.}

\item{beta_prior}{Shape parameter 2 of the Beta prior for the response rate.}

\item{N}{Total sample size for the trial.}

\item{n_interim}{A vector specifying the sample sizes for each interim stage.
The sum of this vector must not exceed \code{N}.}

\item{go_cutoffs}{A vector of go decision thresholds for each stage (excluding the final stage).
Must be non-increasing.}

\item{no_go_cutoffs}{A vector of no-go decision thresholds for each stage (excluding the final stage).
Must be non-decreasing.}

\item{cv1}{Benchmark for the first criterion (e.g., minimum acceptable response rate).}

\item{cv2}{Benchmark for the second criterion (e.g., desirable response rate for success).}

\item{sig_level}{Significance level for the first criterion (e.g., probability of success >= \code{cv1}).}

\item{orr}{True overall response rate assumed for the simulation.}

\item{n_final_iterations}{Number of Monte Carlo samples to draw from the posterior distribution
for the final stage. Default is 10000.}

\item{seed}{An optional random seed for reproducibility. Default is 12345.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{summary}: A data frame summarizing the results, with columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{Decision}: The decision type ("early go", "early no-go", "final go", "final no-go").
\item \code{Count}: The number of times each decision occurred.
\item \code{Percentage}: The percentage of simulations resulting in each decision.
\item \code{Expected_Sample_Size}: The mean sample size used across all trials.
}
\item \code{results}: A list of data frames, each representing the detailed results of a single trial.
}
}
\description{
This function simulates a Bayesian adaptive trial for a specified number of iterations
(e.g., 1000) and summarizes the results, including counts and percentages of each
decision outcome (e.g., "early go", "early no-go", "final go", "final no-go") and
the expected sample size across all trials.
